    Get ready for a safari into the heart of fiber cultivation, where we're using a set of wild indicators to evaluate animal welfare practices! The first indicator is like our animal guardian, checking the structure of the Animal Welfare Management Plan (AWMP). It's all about making sure our fluffy flocks are protected, with a keen eye on the social and environmental impact – think of it as a superhero cape for our animal friends.
    Now, meet the second indicator, the Animal Welfare Whisperer! It's all about adaptive monitoring, using the Pressure, State, Response (PSR) framework. Imagine it like a conversation with our animal buddies, where we're checking for pressures, understanding the current state of animal welfare, and taking actions based on our furry friends' needs. It's like having a secret language with our animal companions!
    Last but not least, our third indicator is the Animal Welfare Dreamer. It dreams big about how programs treat their animal pals. It's considering everything from growth and intensification to the overall importance of animal welfare and the positive outcomes we're aiming for. It's like painting a picture of a world where happy animals reign supreme!
    In a nutshell, `it's a wild adventure into the world of animal welfare in fiber cultivation, where indicators are like magical guides ensuring our animal friends have the best possible life on the farm! 🐾🌾🌟

    Imagine we're on a mission to check how programs handle chemicals in making fibers. The Chemical Management Plan (CMP) is
    like a guide, ensuring safety and aligning with the environment.<br>
    <br>Programs are working to use fewer chemicals, recycling where possible. They monitor everything closely with third-party
    checks and targets.<br>
    <br>Beyond safety, they dream big about managing chemicals, thinking about growth and positive outcomes. The assessment
    checks thoroughly for any possible spills.<br>
    <br>In a nutshell, it's a journey where programs blend responsible chemical use with sustainability. üåê‚ú®

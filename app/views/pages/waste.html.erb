    Picture this: we're on a waste-busting adventure in the world of production, armed with a set of cool indicators! The
    first one is like our waste superhero, checking out plans to reduce waste. It's all about tracking and separating raw
    materials, plus having a super-smart strategy for long-term waste reduction. Sustainability is the name of the game!<br>
    <br>Now, let's talk efficiency with our second indicator – the waste utilization maestro! It's like a ninja, sneaking around
    to see how well we're using our waste streams. Are we tracking them with ninja precision, using smart strategies, and
    rocking a circular dance of recycling? That's the key to being waste-wise!<br>
    <br>And then, cue the drumroll for our third indicator, the Feedstock Detective! This one's on a mission to discover where
    our materials come from. Certified organic agricultural waste, post-consumer gems, or post-industrial wonders – it's
    like a treasure hunt for the most eco-friendly feedstock.<br>
    <br>In a nutshell, it's a production party where we're reducing waste like superheroes, dancing in the circular rhythm,
    and uncovering the most sustainable treasures for our creations! 🌟🌍♻️
